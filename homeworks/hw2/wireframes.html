The design of the website is categorized into different sections that promotes Uber's safety and locations; it also promotes UberEats and etc. </p>

							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I believe that the website did not highlight its logo due to its small size. In the redesign, the logo was made bigger. </p>
